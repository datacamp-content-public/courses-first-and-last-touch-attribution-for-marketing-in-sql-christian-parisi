## First Touch Attribution in SQL

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "fc1a94a7ff"
```

title: Head of Data and Analytics, Quidd


`@script`
Welcome back to First and Last Touch attribution for marketing in SQL with Christian Parisi.  Now that we've covered last touch attribution, let's discuss first touch attribution and some of the things we need to consider when using SQL to perform this type of analysis.

## Lookback Windows

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f639924f5d"
```

`@part1`
- Allow us to consider how far back to consider a visit {{1}}

- Differents types of businesses have different considerations for lookback periods  {{2}}


- INTERVAL SQL function allows us to specify how far prior to the first purchase we want to look back.  {{3}}

`@script`
1) Our first consideration is a lookback window.  These allow us to specify how far back in time we want to look at visits when considering if it was the first touch.  

2) For example, it makes a lot more sense to look at a web visit six months ago for a user that bought a car online but makes less sense for a digital food ordering platform attributing a purchase from last evening.  Point is that different lines of businesses will have different rules for considering lookback periods and this framework can be applied to all.

3) When we write the SQL query we have the ability to do a calculation with the date using INTERVALS.  In this case, we want to only look at visits that took place within the 30 days prior to the first purchase date.  

4) This is done by subtracting â€“ INTERVAL 30 days from the first purchase date in a where clause to only consider visits in that time frame.

## Finding the first visit...

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2e2f428c37"
```

`@part1`
- Leverages same grouping and aggregation framework as last touch attribution {{1}}

- New function: MIN() {{1}}

- MIN function with grouping by user_id, first utm_source {{2}}

- ![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4453/datasets/78b02d4b494e28d25af865f640539c7f7a091a79/first_visit_by_source_and_user_id.png) {{2}}


`@script`
1) With a lookback window in hand, we will use the same aggregation framework we used for last touch attribution but instead use a new function: MIN().  Just like MAX() gave us the largest value MIN() gives us the smallest value.  

2) You can see we are grouping the querying by the user_id, utm_source, and first_purchase_date.  This returns the minimum visit_date for that grouping.  Let's take a look at the results

## ...but something looks wrong.

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c9d0a4fd1f"
```

`@part1`
- ![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4453/datasets/31f4997390c40860f10a671cf4cd00f2bd63f511/many_firsts_results.png)

- You can't have two first visits


`@script`
Unfortunately, something looks wrong here as each utm_source has its own first visit so we need a method to find which source truly generated the first visit.    This is evident for user_id 1234 who has two "first" visits in our results which are attributed to two different sources, Facebook and Google on different days.  We can use a four-step SQL process to resolve this issue.


---
## Step 1: A subquery for overall first visit

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1db26ff240"
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4453/datasets/e1ea53298691f6f93bb297093dd3fda90a6162ee/overall_first_visit_sub.png)

- This gives us the first overall visit that a user had within our lookback window.


`@script`
Our first step to resolve the problem is to generate a subquery to find the true first visit date for our users in the lookback window with no consideration for source.  We do this by putting parathesis around an aggregated MIN query grouping only on the user_id and adding a name at the close parenthesis.   The name of our subquery is 'overall_first_visit'.


---
## Step 2: A subquery for first visit by utm_source

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f1b3e4a42f"
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4453/datasets/8d3dea32d4a6460bce03d770f5e4ce3485a32a42/first_source_visit_sub.png)

- This is the first visit for a user by source which was our original query


`@script`
Our second step is similar to the first step.  The difference here is we add an additional grouping variable, utm_source, to our subquery and name the subquery source_first_visit.    This is the same query we used originally that returned duplicates.


---
## Step 3: Joining the subqueries

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "577b0e8f14"
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4453/datasets/9f15644d5ee15e9f34e0fce29413a30391b127cf/the_join.png)

- Joining allows us to get data that matches between within both subqueries.


`@script`
For our third step, we place a join between the two subqueries using an on statement after the last subquery to perform a join which merges the two subqueries together when there are matching conditions.  In this case, we would be joining the user ids as well as the aggregate first dates from each subquery.  The results will only be rows where the user_id and the first_visit_date is the same.


---
## Step 4: Selecting your data fields

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "043ec60b3d"
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4453/datasets/0b9eca6c9c7979deba09073ddf252c4d2194b5be/select_subqueries.png)

- Select the fields you want from the subqueries


`@script`
For our final step we do a simple select statement on those joined subqueries so we can return the user_id, their first utm_source, and the date of their first visit.

Lets take a look at the results.

## First touch visits results

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "cf861138c2"
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4453/datasets/19692139718b57e9f69f9a6fff926a62499e7e80/only_one_first_results.png)

- Duplication issue has been resolved

- We have the true first visits in the lookback window by user and utm_source


`@script`
As you can see here that the duplication issue no longer exists with our user ids and we can tell which visit from which source should be considered for first touch attribution within the lookback window we specified.

## Lets Practice.

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "8439793603"
```

`@script`
The 4 step framework you just learned can be used to do first touch attributions across all different types of aggregations and lookback windows. Let's give it a try in the following excercises.
